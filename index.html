    <h1>This is my project!!!</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">The 27 year-old listener discusses hearing voices, dealing with Borderline Personality disorder and/or Bipolar II, hypomania as well as the abusive “relationship” she had with a 22 year-old when she was 12 and how she began self-harming then. The surveys are pretty dark.</h2>

<p> Sophie: Yea, so after, I mean we all felt really close to each other, but it wasn't a real closeness, because it's not something you build up overtime it's kind of superficial, but I was feeling comfortable with everyone and I sort of admired him anyway and we exchanged screen names, this is back in the day when you do the AOL instant messenger and so we started talking online and I felt safe with him and he treated me like an equal. Like he didn't treat me like a child and I think that's something that people, children need to look out for and it's hard to recognize because you want to be treated equally when you're young especially when you're around that age, 12 or 13, you want to be treated as an adult.</p>
<p> Paul: And to me a red flag right away is somebody having an online relationship with that age difference.</p>

<p >S: Yea and it progressed where we started hanging out one on one and then I would sneak out of my house and he would come pick me up and take me back to his apartment. At the time, I thought it was a real relationship, I know now it wasn't. And even for years after that I always saw it as a great thing, a great experience.</p>

<p  >P: You want to be older, it's like 'I'm 12 and a half!'</p>

<p>S: Yea it wasn't until my early twenties that I came to terms with the fact that it was sexual abuse, it was child abuse and it was something that was very harmful to me.</p>

<p >P: Was it when you became his age that you could see it?</p>

<p >S: Yea, I think so, cause I started to realized, woah imagine me, you know, getting into some situation with a 12 year old boy, like that just seems terrible.</p>

<p>P: What did you feel or think when that moment hit you?</p>

<p>S: Um, I felt really like, I felt like I was taken advantage of, like obviously I was physically taken advantage of, but I felt like everything I had thought about who I was, like I was an adult and I was sophisticated, it was all a lie. And it really sort of cut me down to size.</p>
<p>P: I think that's what hurts the most about sexual abuse, is the being tricked.</p>
<p>S: Yea and it's hard now, because if I met him today, if I saw him today, I don't know if I'd punch him in the face or hug him. You know, there's still that part of me that remembers thinking that I was totally in love with him, so that's really hard to deal with, knowing it was abuse and still having that tenderness for him. You know it's really shocking and upsetting to me.</p>

<p>P: Thank you for sharing that part of it, because I think that's one of the most difficult things in confronting the abuse that happened to you, to us, is that its so complicated because there are often positive feelings towards the abuser and you feel like you're throwing them under the bus to call them a predator or whatever. Because we do often see that humanity, but then we also think to ourselves, was it all an act? But my thought is that, I don't think there can be genuine tenderness between somebody who is in the state of abusing somebody, to me it all falls under the heading of grooming and mind control. I think.. I don't know that's just my personal opinion, but getting back to the time that you spent with him, like what would he say to you to introduce the physical aspect?</p>
<p>S: Well, I think and this is something that's really difficult for me to swallow, is that I think I instigated it. If he was so smart grooming me that you know I thought I was in charge of the situation and then we started talking online and I don't remember if I brought it up or if he brought it up, like 'oh, come pick me up.'</p>
<p  >S: Yea, I mean, it's just hard to swallow, it's hard to wrap my head around and it's hard for me to understand because I have great male role models, I was never abused by anyone else like physically or emotionally, so it just came out of no where and that's something thats really hard to deal with. Like, where did this come from, how is it so easy for me to be preyed upon?</p>
<p>P: I'm glad you shared that, because I know there are so many listeners that are feeling and thinking that same thing, so then they want to go to the place 'well I must be inherently bad' or perverted, or I hate the word “slutty” or they wanted that and it breaks my heart to think that somebody is putting any of the blame on themselves. Where are you today with that thing, have you let go of the shame and the blame?</p>
<p>S: Um, intellectually I have, like I understand now that I was so young and I was being manipulated and that, you know, I don't understand why I did it, but it happened. But emotionally, I still hang on to that and I still feel shame and thats hard to get over.</p>
<p>P: You're inferring that it was your decision.</p>
<p>S: Oh, right. Like that I had the power?</p>
<p>P: Yea and thats the part of the sick genius of the predator, is they make you think that you have a choice in this. They sense what you long for as a child and they pervert that need for it, to lure you into what it is that they want from you and they give you the illusion that you wanted it. When what you probably wanted was so much more pure than that. I would imagine, you just wanted the attention from this guy?</p>
<p>S: I thought that I was totally in love, like I thought it was true love. Like this was the wonderful magical thing.</p>
<p>P: And it's totally... I remember having a huge crush on my sixth grade teacher, totally appropriate to have that crush. But that crush when we're 12 years old is a fantasy and they prey on that, they prey on that fantasy, knowing what the long term effect of it are. I guess that's what I want to point out, for the people that are listening, I'm not trying to be your therapist, I just, those little cracks in our defense of wanting to avoid the reality that we were helpless and vulnerable, I want to try to fill those crack so we can recover more easily because I go through the same things that you, even though our situations were different, I go through the same mindfuck of: well why didn't I say this feels weird? I don't want to do this. Why did I go along with it? Etc etc. And I just feel like that's important for people to understand how powerful that adult figure is to us and what a uneven match we are emotionally and intellectually. We're like these little sponges that want love so badly, and want to be older.</p>
<p>S: Yea, I think it's that combination of wanting the love and to be this mature, beyond our age person.</p>
<p>P: To where we have autonomy and power that's used against us. Yea come on into the adult world! It's all going to be okay! So, go ahead.</p>
